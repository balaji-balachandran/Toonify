# Algorithms and Data Structures
Huffman - Encodes and decodes image data
Our Huffman algorithm accesses an image and converts it between a png filee and raw binary data

SLIC - Uses the data given by the Huffman algorithm to process the image and output the toonified image

Splay - Finds the average color in the algorithm


# Leading Question
We were able to create a working image result
